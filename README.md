**Rg.Plugins.Popup** - is a cross platform plugin for [Xamarin.Forms](https://www.xamarin.com/forms) which allows to open Xamarin.Forms pages as a popup that can be shared across iOS, Android and UWP (macOS supporting will be soon). Also the plugin allows to use very simple and flexible animations for showing popup pages. For more information see [Wiki](https://github.com/rotorgames/Rg.Plugins.Popup/wiki)
